# DecentralizedVotingSystem

## üìò Project Description
This project implements a simple decentralized voting system on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. It allows participants to vote once for a predefined set of candidates in a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof way.

## üéØ Project Vision
To create a trustless and immutable voting platform that ensures transparency, eliminates fraud, and builds confidence in digital elections.

## üîë Key Features
- üó≥ One person, one vote (voting locked per address)
- üßæ Real-time vote count per candidate
- üîê Immutable record of votes on-chain
- üìú Public candidate list accessible to all users

## üî≠ Future Scope
- Role-based permissions (e.g., voter registration)
- Vote anonymization using zero-knowledge proofs
- Off-chain frontend integration
- Multiple election rounds and time-locking
